###Interests:
I am interested in performing Bayesian analysis for a   variety of research problems on the interstellar medium.  One example is the relationship between the star formation rate Σ<sub>SFR</sub> and the molecular gas surface density Σ<sub>mol</sub>, known as the Kennicutt-Schmidt relationship (Schmidt 1959, Kennicutt 1989).  Those quantities are often discussed as a linear relationship with slope 1.0, such that the gas depletion time τ<sub>dep</sub><sup>CO</sup>  = Σ<sub>mol</sub>/Σ<sub>SFR</sub> is constant.  However, the conversion factors between the observables to estimate Σ<sub>mol</sub> and Σ<sub>SFR</sub> are treated as constants.  I aim to investigate the correlations between the conversion factors, as well as the Kennicutt-Schmidt relationship, simultaneously, using hierarchical Bayesian methods.

__Sample Data:__ The figure above shows data from the spiral galaxy M51, which was part of the HERACLES survey of nearby galaxies (Bigiel et al. 2008).  The points are show the gas depletion time and the gas surface density.  The lines show the best fit (thick), and 95% confidence interval (thin).  The thick dashed line shows a constant depletion time of 2 Gyr.  The data clearly suggests an increasing depletion time with surface density.  Such trends raise the question as to how conversion factor variations affect such relationships (Shetty et al. 2014).

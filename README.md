** Interests:** I'm interested in performing Bayesian analysis for a
   variety of research problems in astronomy.  One example is the
   relationship between the star formation rate $\Sigma_{SFR}$ and the
   molecular gas surface density $\Sigma_{mol}$, known as the
   Kennicutt-Schmidt relationship.  Those quantities are often
   discussed as a linear relationship with slope 1.0, such that the
   gas depletion time $\tau_{dep} = \Sigma_{mol}/\Sigma_{SFR}$ is
   constant.  However, the conversion factors between the observables
   and $\Sigma_{mol}$ and $\Sigma_{SFR}$ are treated as constants.  I
   aim to investigate the correlations between the conversion factors,
   as well as the Kennicutt-Schmidt relationship, simultaneously,
   using hierarchical Bayesian methods.

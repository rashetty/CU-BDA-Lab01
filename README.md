###Interests:
I'm interested in performing Bayesian analysis for a
   variety of research problems in astronomy.  One example is the
   relationship between the star formation rate $\Sigma_{SFR}$ and the
   molecular gas surface density $\Sigma_{mol}$, known as the
   Kennicutt-Schmidt relationship.  Those quantities are often
   discussed as a linear relationship with slope 1.0, such that the
   gas depletion time $\tau_{dep} = \Sigma_{mol}/\Sigma_{SFR}$ is
   constant.  However, the conversion factors between the observables
   and $\Sigma_{mol}$ and $\Sigma_{SFR}$ are treated as constants.  I
   aim to investigate the correlations between the conversion factors,
   as well as the Kennicutt-Schmidt relationship, simultaneously,
   using hierarchical Bayesian methods.

** Sample Data:** The figure above shows data from the spiral galaxy M51, which was part of the THINGS survey of nearby galaxies (Bigiel et al. 2008).  The points are show the gas depletion time and the gas surface density.  The lines show the best fit (thick), and 95% confidence interval (thin).  The thick dashed line shows a constant depletion time of 2 Gyr.  The data clearly suggests an increasing depletion time with surface density.  One question is how conversion factor variations affect such relationships.

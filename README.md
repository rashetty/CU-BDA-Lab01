** Basic Information:**  Rahul Shetty, MPS Student, final semester

** Interests:**  I'm interested in performing Bayesian analysis for a variety of research problems in astronomy.  One example is the relationship between the star formation rate R and the gas surface density S, known as the Kennicutt-Schmidt relationship.  Those quantities are often discussed as a linear relationship, such that the gas depletion time S/R is constant.   However, the conversion factors between the observables and R and S are treated as constants.  I aim to investigate the correlations between the conversion factors, as well as the Kennicutt-Schmidt relationship, simultaneously, using hierarchical Bayesian methods.
